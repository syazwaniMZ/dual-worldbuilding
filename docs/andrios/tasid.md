# Republic of Tasid
 Recently claimed itself to be a democratic power after overthrowing the previous government, both by words and blood, the Republic stands proud amongst wastelands and the frigid cold weather. Currently in truce with the Empire.

## Region
### Agral
 Capital of the Republic. The folks that often shunned and feared up north are welcomed here with open arms. Warm drinks are shared in rooms where heated debates take place. A meeting point for ideas and knowledge to be shared without fear. Factories are built into the mountainsides, creating machines of unknown capabilities.

### Ostren
 The Republic goldmine for learning, sciences, technology, and research. The howling mountain winds hardly disturb the concentration of the diligent pupils.

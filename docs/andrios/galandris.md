## Locations
The Empire reigns over two cities, and five townships.

### Galandria
<sup> _Main article: [City of Galandria]({% link docs/andrios/galandria.md %})_ </sup><br>
Jewel and capital of the Empire. This is where the Empress resides, and home to the largest Sollian church.

### Yorktown
An unassuming port town. Relatively uneventful, but there are whispers of strange waves in the western seas.

### Athefort
 A bustling commerce city thanks to the channel, the city bright lights are a welcome sight to weary sailors looking for entertainment and comfort. Its ivory white walls are the Empire line of defense against the Republic influence.

### Fare Coast
 A town spread out along pearly white beach sands. A usual tourist spot for the nobles and the rich to spend time during the summer. 

### Gaidren
 A place of learning and of faith. This is the town where oldest church dedicated to Nylmat resides, and home to monasteries for monks and students of magic.

### Brendale
A farming village protected from the harsh monsoons. Often covered by a light mist, it hid a centuries old conspiracy. This is where a corrupted angel known as the **Harvester** made demands of children to be sacrificed to him, or he would release a vault of plague that can kill nations. 

The foster mother of the orphanage tasked with sending children to the Harvester grew tired of losing the ones under her care. She chose to send neglected children of the town instead of hers out of desperation and love.

## Society
The Last Queen set the precedent that adopted children have the same rights as biological children to claim inheritance of wealth and title. 

Children without two parents to care for them will be taken by the empire to be put in orphanages or seminary. The **Crown** deemed that the child would be neglected or be in danger if not put in a system. Often children of single parents or divorced parents are at risk of being taken away, so it is common for parents to hide or lie about their actual status as a single parent.

## Politics
The Empire is ruled by the **Court** which headed by an empress, aided by a class of nobility collectively named as the **House of Lords**, and influential upperclass citizens holding administory position called the **Ministers**.

<p style="text-align: center;">Succession of a new empress are always bloody.</p>

During the long winter, there was ongoing tension between the labourer class and the ruling class as food shortage intensifies. At the same time a long lost descendant of Issac was making a move against the Empress by spreading anti-Court propaganda and instigating riots. 

Concurrently, runaway Tasidian elves schemed to overtake the capital by planting would-be giant trees that would destroy the cityâ€™s foundation.

Weeks of protests and clashes culminated in the death of Empress Ghislaine, and the local elves being captured as suspects of the conspiracy.

## Before the Beginning
The world of Hos was formed from the dust of **Celestial War**. The war which ended when the **World Engine**, the machine that mantained the previous universe, was destroyed by a powerful  subjugated race called **Cels**.

Without home, the surviving Cels traveled to **Hos**, and arrived in the continent of **Andrios** where there were no living civilization to contend with. Here, they shaped the lands and wild beasts to roam the continent.

## Era of Settlers
The first human settlers arrived in the northern peninsula of the then-unnamed continent, which they then chose the name Andrios. Then came the orcish race who sailed from the south poles to settle the south. Around the same time, the elves arrived through their **Endless Tree**, and into the center of the continent where verdant forest lay.

At first, the Cels simply watched the settlers take to the continent. Once the settlers saw the Cels, the settlers were in awe of their enormity and knowledge. The settlers deified the Cels and prayed to them for favors. The Cels, who were never respected in their homeworld, were touched by the gesture. After being regarded as gods, the Cels granted protection and guidance to the settlers as they made their home in Andrios.

## The Dwarven Era
The dwarves were the first race to become dominant on the continent. At the height of their civilization, their underground cities wrapped the whole of Hos. It came to an abrupt end when they mined far too deep into the earth, and found a piece of the World Engine. The machine awakened and shared its knowledge and intent to destroy the Cels. As the dwarves were beyond their gods’ watchful eye to call for the gods’ wisdom, the dwarves destroyed the piece of the World Engine. The ensuing explosion sank Andrios and their beloved city into the seas.

## Cthonic Era
Millions of lives were lost, and many more were displaced among pockets of civilizations. The seafolks took the opportunity of the chaos and expanded their kingdom. The former land-dwellers became an underclass in the underwater kingdom. The gods took pity and gifted them the knowledge of all languages, which allowed them to use powerful magics. Enlightened, the people of Andrios used their magic to give wings to the seafolk army’s wyrms and then conspired together to take their sunken city into the skies, leaving the seafolk kingdom behind.

---
## Empyrean Era
The height of magical knowledge. Floating cities, massive technological advancements, and dragonkin among the population. The people of Andrios, who used to be at the gods’ feet, finally could witness the full form of their gods.

The relationship between the gods and the worshipers became personal. Sects of followers began to match their favorite god with another, inevitably sowing yearning and jealousy among the gods. The innocent schemes turned into a full-blown war when Nex and Sollian fought over Nylmat’s attention. The conflict was brought to a decisive end when Sollian sundered Nex, splitting the continent and mortally wounded Nylmat. Ashes covered the earth and sky, causing a famine. Ashamed of the act, Sollian left the realm and his blade to his devoted followers. Gaiun, who stayed away from the conflict, brought life again to the continent and ensured the people could feed. He then carried Nylmat to the moon to allow her to recover from her wound.

## After Sundering
The followers are left to fend for themselves after the gods leave Andrios. The most devoted of Sollian, the **Last Queen**, took his blade and united Sollian’s faithfuls to form a kingdom in the northern half of the continent. She was aided by the **Blind Prophet**, who then disappeared in the south to form what would be the current’s Tasid.

The Last Queen never married, so she took in orphans to become her heirs. After she passed, her heirs, Issac and Galandris fought over the throne, with Galandris as the victor and Issac cursed with lycanthropy.

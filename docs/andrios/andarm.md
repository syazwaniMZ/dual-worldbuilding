# Andarm Federation

A federation of independent city states. Home to rough folks and rougher weather. Inspired by South Asia, mostly  Pakistan and India.


Uran
 Used to be constantly under attacks by the Empire, but its rough terrain managed to keep the Empire at bay for centuries. Now in friendly terms with the Empire, but its people never forgets.


Andar
 Perhaps the oldest city in the continent. The cityâ€™s buildings are being built on top of each other-- higher and higher to maximise space. Stories of caverns lined with magic runes, and ghosts kept the place interesting.

Zulas
 Warm weather and surrounded by swamps, this is where the toughest champions, fighters and sailors call home. Yearly events of showmanship and sports are held here.

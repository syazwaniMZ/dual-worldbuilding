The world is split into 16 regions, with no clear borders as it shifts with the ecology, the waters, and seasons. Iris Engineers's nucleartrain tracks connect most of the regions.

# Regions

| Name | Description                               |
|:-----|:------------------------------------------|
| Anahuac | The study of freedom is one of the earliest known recovered records in Anahuac. Its community organizing projects are subjects of academic research. The peoples here are staunch vanguards of their natural environment no matter if its verdant rainforest or the harsh arid shrub lands. |

| Asadal | Island of nuclear, cherry blossoms, and love. The birthplace of Iris, a paramilitary faction of engineers and intelects. The marriage of institutional academia and agriculture led to many petty drama, inspiring countless digital novels and games. |
| Carbaretta | People dance and drink over fraught cities, haunted by countless wars older than recorded time. The Deathless stalks fiercely here. Ancient archives and valuable vaults hid amongst the ruins. |

| Lunagrad | Ages worth of poisonous clouds drifted from all over the world left the mountains and the steppes barely livable. Adapted folks thrive here by bioremediating the toxins for their needs. |
| Nunangat | Lands, waters, and ice. In the extreme conditions, engineers kept up the light on by converting waste into energy. Hunters would collect old tech scraps that drift into their water for hunting and building materials, and arts. |
| Nzere | The beating heart of the world, Nzere is the wellspring of highly valuable Cel-based technology. Technologist and light-farmer convene in the sun-baked desert once every cycle. |
| Qinaya | Avant garde community terraces dots the diverse landscape. Their tenants: Syndicalist tinkerers and muralist, who pioneer influential art and tech movements. |
| Sayang | Sea sailors and traders built their home in the mangroves that grew over ancient sunken cities. Traders Commune began here, to fulfill the needs of the disconnected islanders. <br> Locale: <b>[Pepanggil]({% link docs/sunlit/pepanggil.md %})</b>|
| Suhul Eatra | Hydrologist and archaeologist often brave through the sand dunes to recover long lost architectures and artifacts. The sands have swallowed history and it will swallow again. Despite that, sand-surfing is popular during dry season. |

| Yurntirri | An idyllic landscape verdant with transcendent energy, the calm only interrupted by the ferocious creatures and violent gang wars. |

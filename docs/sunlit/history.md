# History

The Extraction Era was a time of war, famine, and climate disasters. The so-called leaders and leeches left the world to fend for itself. Planet wide communications failed as all satellite connections were suddenly gone. Driven to connect families and friends in times of turmoil, people began to collectively build the neurolink.

However, the City Lord took the opportunity of the coming peace and weapon de-escalation by claiming lands as their birthright to shepherd.  They abused the neurolink to subjugate both people and machines, and in turn manifested the Deathless, a virus that only seeks to subsume and grow.

It took the combined effort of various factions and free people to squash the City Lordâ€™ reign and the Deathless.

With that, the Era of Concords begins. An era where people live in harmony with nature, technology.

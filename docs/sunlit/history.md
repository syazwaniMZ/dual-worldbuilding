# History

The Extraction Era was a time of war, famine, and climate disasters. The so-called leaders and leeches left the world to fend for itself. Planet wide communications failed as all satellite connections were suddenly gone. Driven to connect families and friends in times of turmoil, people began to collectively build the neurolink.

However, the City Lord took the opportunity of the coming peace and weapon de-escalation by claiming lands as their birthright to shepherd.  They abused the neurolink to subjugate both people and machines, and in turn manifested the Deathless, a virus that only seeks to subsume and grow.

It took the combined effort of various factions and free people to squash the City Lordâ€™ reign and the Deathless.

With that, the Era of Concords begins. An era where people live in harmony with nature, technology.

## The Human Census

The emergent life forms that appeared near the end of the Extraction Era brought questions to what is regarded as part of humanity.

After a long, fraught online debate, the global census concluded that the **Adapted** people who were genetically changed must be regarded as human. This includes the **Synthetics**, who were artificially created by humanity, and must be regarded as part of humanity. The points were:

1. **They originated from humans.**

2. **The Adapted and the Synthetics are mortal.**
It's wrong to assume Synthetics can live forever. Even a well-maintained computer can barely last longer than an entire human lifespan. If their CPUs are changed, they are no longer the same person.

3. **They need things to live.**
Some Adapted might require a special diet with specific processes, but some humans already require specialized diet and care. The Synthetics, on the other hand, need fuel, maintenance, and rest to cool down their systems, which humans also need.

4. **They are conscious.**
The ability to think for themselves and their community, imagine beyond what's possible, reason, and reflect are all human markers. If the Adapted and the Synthetics possess these, they must be part of humanity.

# Sunlit
Sunlit sets on earth, countless lifetimes from now. It is a post-scarcity world, where food and shelter is freely given. Green technology in harmony with earth as people thrive and develop culture.

Yet it is not utopic. People would still fight, kill and die from diseases and accidents. Extreme weather is the norm. Parts of the earth reclaimed by wild nature are deadly to the unprepared. Then there is the Deathless swarm, infecting machines and synthetic lifeforms.

## The Empty Song

The Empty Song is a virus, transferable via audio frequency and online networks. It is lethal to machines and machine-based lifeforms. Once it takes hold of the main CPU and memory, the infected will override their moral limiter. The virus-infected will prioritize maximizing their processing power and spreading the Empty Song by any means necessary. These are what we call the Deathless.

{: .note}
The [Moralists]({% link docs/sunlit/factions.md %}) recommended course of action is to completely shut down your devices, or at the very least toggle off every networking and audio input capabilities on your persons before you approach the infected or enter within range of Empty Song.

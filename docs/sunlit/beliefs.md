# Beliefs

Near the end of the Extraction Era, the beliefs in the Random Factor and the World began to appear.

## The Random Factor
The belief that everything occurs by accident. Without higher design nor purpose. An act to make meaning of the chaos is considered very powerful.

## The World
The term for reality. The beating heart of the people, and the gentle wind that carries their weariness and passions. That there is consciousness and memories that surrounds and connects every living thing. The World is thought to be the only thing that truly matters because there is nothing after this reality.

## End Timers
Few communities exist still, carrying on their ancestral traditions that came before the Extraction Era. Though the End Timers —which is a broad category applied to many pre-Extraction religions— had plenty of ups and downs in the Era of Concord. Their devotees had mostly abandoned most of their ideologies, but some stubbornly championed it still. Regardless of their beliefs, society deems that no one deserves to be left isolated and unfed.
